# Changelog

## v2.9.0

### Added

- **Login expiry warning**: the polling leader DMs allowlisted users once a day from 3 days before the Claude Code login expires, so an expired login no longer leaves the bot silent without explanation. Expiry comes from `TELEGRAM_AUTH_EXPIRES_AT` (set it for a `claude setup-token` token, which carries no readable expiry), else from the OAuth refresh token in `.credentials.json`. Checked at startup and every 6 hours.

## v2.8.1

### Fixed

- **BotFather command menu is no longer overridden**: the server stopped setting `/start`, `/help`, `/status` at `all_private_chats` scope on bot start, and the `SessionStart` skill sync is now opt-in (`"commands": { "sync": true }` in `command-config.json`). Both wrote scopes that outrank BotFather's default scope. With sync off, the hook deletes the `all_private_chats` and per-chat menus earlier versions left behind, once (marker `.commands-cleared`).

## v2.8.0

### Added

- **API failure notice**: a `StopFailure` hook tells the Telegram chat when an API error (rate limit, overload, billing, auth, server error, output token limit) ends the turn before Claude can reply. The `⚠️ Can't reply: …` message quotes Claude Code's own error line, which carries the reset time for rate limits. One notice per error type per 10 minutes, so messages sent while limited don't spam the chat. Turns that fail before any tool call still count: the session that received the message claims the turn by its transcript.

### Fixed

- **Stuck progress after an API error**: Claude Code fires `StopFailure` instead of `Stop` on a failed turn, so the progress message kept its Stop button and the typing daemon kept running. The failure hook now collapses and cleans up like `Stop`.

## v2.7.0

Bot API 10.2/10.3 features (Stop button, embedded media, compact tables, disabled buttons, thinking drafts) and the upstream v0.0.7 reliability fixes.

### Added

- **Stop a running turn from Telegram**: the live progress message carries a `⏹ Stop` button; draft-mode progress uses the native draft Stop button (Bot API 10.3 `can_stop` + `stopped_message_generation`). Either sends Escape to the owning session's tmux pane (recorded by the hooks when they claim the turn) and collapses the trace as `⏹ Stopped after N steps`. Outside tmux the user gets "Can't stop".
- **Files embedded in rich replies** (Bot API 10.2/10.3): with `format: "markdown"`, `reply` files ride inside the same rich message as `f1…fN` via `InputRichMessageMedia` (multipart upload) — 2+ photos/videos become one `<tg-collage>`, other files follow as media blocks, and `![caption](tg://photo?id=f1)` places one inline (the scheme is corrected per file type). Falls back to separate messages if the embed is rejected. Replaces the `curl sendMediaGroup` workaround in the MCP instructions.
- **Compact tables** (Bot API 10.3): GFM tables on the rich path are rewritten to `<table compact>` with column alignment, so more fits on a phone.
- **Expandable quotes on the rich path**: `>!` quotes now render as `<blockquote expandable>` in rich messages and rich edits too (previously only the MarkdownV2 fallback understood them).
- **Answered keyboards stay visible** (Bot API 10.3 disabled buttons): tapping a `reply` button disables the whole keyboard and marks the chosen button `✓` instead of removing it; servers without disabled buttons still get the keyboard removed.
- **Thinking block in draft progress** (Bot API 10.2): rich drafts show completed steps as a blockquote and the in-flight tool in the native animated `<tg-thinking>` block (`Thinking…` between tools).

### Changed

- **State dir**: server, hooks and both skills resolve `TELEGRAM_STATE_DIR`, then `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/channels/telegram`, then `~/.claude/channels/telegram`. The skills previously hardcoded the default path, so a custom state dir silently ignored pairing and allowlist edits (upstream #1424).
- **Embedded prompts**: MCP instructions and tool descriptions cover Stop, embedded media, compact tables, `>!` on both paths and disabled keyboards; skills use the plugin's real `/claude-telegram-companion:*` command names and `access set` documents `permissionApprovers`; `/help` mentions Stop.

### Fixed

- **Self-termination ~5s after launch**: the orphan watchdog's `ppid` check misfired when the `bun run` wrapper exited during startup. Stdin closing is the only shutdown signal now (upstream #1424).
- **MCP handshake corrupted by `bun install` output**: the start script sends install output to stderr instead of the JSON-RPC stdout (upstream #1424).
- **PID reuse in the poll lock**: a recycled PID no longer passes as a live leader; the holder must still be a `server.ts` process (`ps -o args=`), else followers would wait forever and nothing would poll.
- **In-flight-only trace**: if the turn ends while the only step is still in flight, that step is folded into the final collapsed trace instead of deleting the progress message.
- **Trace ownership**: only the session whose transcript contains the inbound `<channel chat_id=…>` block claims a turn, and a follow-up message mid-turn no longer resets the running trace.
- **Draft progress layout**: completed steps render one per line (markdown quote lines used to soft-wrap into one).

## v2.6.0

Persistent tool-call checklist, automatic progress (no `ack` round trip), rich edits, and hook fast-path fixes.

### Added

- **Persistent progress tracking** (new default, `progress.streamMode: "message"`): the first tool call sends one silent message (`disable_notification`) that is edited in place as a quiet HTML blockquote — ✓ lines for completed tools, ▸ for the in-flight one, `×N` counters for repeats. When the turn ends it collapses into an expandable blockquote summary (`Ran N steps · 42s`) and stays in chat history as background tracking info. Works in groups, unlike drafts. `"draft"` remains available as opt-in; the legacy `"edit"` value maps to `"message"`.
- **Automatic progress start**: the server writes the hook coordination file on every inbound message, so progress tracking and typing begin without Claude calling `ack` first — saving a full model round trip per message. `ack` is now only an explicit typing signal.
- **`Stop` hook**: finalizes and cleans up progress when the turn ends even if no reply was sent (same-session guard), replacing reliance on short staleness windows.
- **Rich edits for `edit_message`**: `format: "markdown"` tries `editMessageText` + `rich_message` (32K, native markdown) before the MarkdownV2 fallback (4K).

### Changed

- **PostToolUse hook gating**: hooks now only spawn when a Telegram turn is actually active (`telegram-active.json` gate) instead of on every tool call in every session on the machine.
- **Draft finalization** moved to PreToolUse of `reply`/`send` and now posts the collapsed expandable-blockquote history (silent) instead of a quoted list.
- **Context staleness** window raised from 120s to 30 minutes and PreToolUse refreshes it, so single tool calls longer than 2 minutes (Agent, long Bash) no longer lose progress tracking; the daemon lifetime is 30 minutes and it also exits when the active context is torn down.
- **Command sync** (`SessionStart`) skips the Telegram round-trip when the command list is unchanged since the last successful sync, and one failing chat id no longer aborts syncing the remaining chats.

### Fixed

- **Empty-progress stub**: a progress message whose only entry was still in flight when the reply landed is deleted instead of left stale.
- **MCP instructions**: progress description, `edit_message` rich-edit capability, and removal of the stale "edit_message is MarkdownV2-only" note.

## v2.5.0

`sendRichMessage` support (Bot API 10.1) and Bot API 9.4 button field fixes.

### Added

- **`sendRichMessage` (Bot API 10.1)**: `format: "markdown"` now tries `sendRichMessage` first — sends raw markdown directly to Telegram with 32K char limit (8x MarkdownV2). Falls back to MarkdownV2 on older servers. Latches off permanently on capability errors to avoid repeated roundtrips. Inspired by [NousResearch/hermes-agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent).
- **Rich progress drafts**: Typing daemon now streams progress via `sendRichMessageDraft` (Bot API 10.1) with native markdown formatting — bold in-progress tool, blockquote container. Falls back to `sendMessageDraft` (HTML) then edit mode.

### Removed

- **`telegram-markdownv2` skill**: Obsolete with `sendRichMessage`. sendMediaGroup instructions moved to MCP server instructions.

### Fixed

- **Button `style` field**: Corrected from hallucinated `background_color` (hex string) to the real Bot API 9.4 `style` field (`"primary"`, `"success"`, `"danger"`).
- **Button `icon_custom_emoji_id`**: Corrected from hallucinated `custom_emoji_id` to the real Bot API 9.4 field name.
- **MCP instructions**: Updated to reflect native table/header support, 32K char limit, and `sendRichMessage` as primary path. Removed stale "no tables" guidance.

## v2.4.0

Telegram Bot API 9.3–9.5 rich-text, streaming, and styling support. Bumps `grammy` to `^1.44.0` for typed access to the new methods.

### Added

- **Native streaming progress** via `sendMessageDraft` (Bot API 9.5+). In private chats the progress indicator now streams as a flicker-free draft that auto-clears when the real reply lands, replacing the edit-based approach. Configurable with `progress.streamMode` (`"draft"` default, `"edit"` to force the legacy behavior); groups and older servers fall back to editing automatically.
- **Richer `format: "markdown"`**: spoilers (`||text||`), native blockquotes (`> line`), expandable/collapsed blockquotes (start the first line with `>!`), and custom emoji (`![glyph](tg://emoji?id=<id>)`) — on top of the existing bold/italic/strike/code/link support.
- **Inbound formatting preserved**: incoming Telegram message entities (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, spoiler, code, pre, links, quotes, custom-emoji glyphs) are reconstructed into markdown before relaying to Claude, instead of being flattened to plain text.
- **Inline button styling**: `reply` buttons accept optional `style` and `icon_custom_emoji_id` (Bot API 9.4).

### Changed

- MarkdownV2 helpers factored into `markdown.ts` with a `bun test` suite (`markdown.test.ts`).

## v2.3.1

### Fixed

- Startup queue replay race condition: `queueReplayPending()` fired immediately after `mcp.connect()`, before Claude Code's channel notification handler was ready. Notifications were written to the stdio pipe (promise resolved, files moved to `delivered/`), but Claude never surfaced them. Added a 5-second delay to the initial replay so the notification handler has time to initialize.

## v2.0.0

Decoupled fork. The plugin now hosts its own Telegram MCP server and no longer depends on `telegram@claude-plugins-official`.

### Breaking

- Skill namespace: `/telegram:access` → `/claude-telegram-companion:access`. Same for `/telegram:configure`.
- Voice transcription via `transcribe` skill removed. Voice messages now flow through the embedded server's `attachment_kind: voice` meta.
- Disable `telegram@claude-plugins-official` to avoid two pollers competing for the bot token.
