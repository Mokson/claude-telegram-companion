# Changelog

## v2.0.0

Decoupled fork. The plugin now hosts its own Telegram MCP server and no longer depends on `telegram@claude-plugins-official`.

### Breaking

- Skill namespace: `/telegram:access` → `/claude-telegram-companion:access`. Same for `/telegram:configure`.
- Voice transcription via `transcribe` skill removed. Voice messages now flow through the embedded server's `attachment_kind: voice` meta. Re-enable with a `TELEGRAM_VOICE_CMD` env var if needed.
- Disable `telegram@claude-plugins-official` to avoid two pollers competing for the bot token.

### Added (cherry-picked PRs from anthropics/claude-plugins-official)

### Stability patches

- `process.stdout` error listener (prevents broken-pipe crashes)
- `mcp.onerror` handler (catches transport-level errors)
- `.catch()` on fire-and-forget `mcp.notification()` calls

### Companion changes

- New `skills/access/` and `skills/configure/` ported from upstream and namespaced
- Hook scripts updated to recognize `mcp__plugin_claude-telegram-companion_telegram__*` tool names

### Deferred to v2.1.0

- In-server `ProgressTracker` (currently still daemon-based)
- Skill discovery engine moved into MCP server
- `MCP instructions` field replacing SessionStart stdout injection
